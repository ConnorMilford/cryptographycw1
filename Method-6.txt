Plaintext m1 is 2^19 < m2 < 2^20
This can therefore be brute forced as it has a keyspace around 520,000

Using a for loop, each i can then be passed to a function to generate a key based on it.
2^19 < i < 2^20.

If this key can decode C2 - the ciphertext of message two, and this Plaintext m2 contains " THE " AND " TO " it can be said the key is correct.

Initially this was returning no results so I changed the function to instead write each potential match:
 string contains " TO " OR " THE " to a seperate file and check it manually for english plaintext.

 This then showed me the plaintext "YOUR HOLDINGS ARE TESLA TWENTY THREE HUNDRED MICROSOFT FOURTY TWO HUNDRED YOU HAVE THIRTY ONE
  THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POUNDS AVAILABLE TO TRADE SEND BUY TO BUY STONKS SEND SELL TO SELL STONKS at 14115"

I then modified the algorithm to search for the word "TESLA"
